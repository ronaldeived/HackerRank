# HackerRank

I've been taking the exercises and tests that I've been doing on the HackerRank platform and adding them to my Git repository, along with a description of how I solved each problem. 

Additionally, I've included unit tests with xUnit to validate the data.

To validate the data, you just need to run the unit tests.

Inside each folder, there is a text file with a description of the test.
